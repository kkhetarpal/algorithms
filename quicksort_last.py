#The file contains all of the integers between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive) 
#in unsorted order (with no integer repeated). 
#The integer in the ith row of the file gives you the ith entry of an input array.
#Your task is to compute the total number of comparisons used to sort the given input file by QuickSort. 
#As you know, the number of comparisons depends on which elements are chosen as pivots, 
#so we'll ask you to explore three different pivoting rules.
#You should not count comparisons one-by-one.
#Compute the number of comparisons (as in Problem 1),
# always using the final element of the given array as the pivot element.
